### Time complexity when comparing elements
Worst-case: O(n^2)
Best-case: O(n^2)
Average: O(n^2)

### Time complexity when swapping elements
Worst-case: O(n^2)
Best-case: O(1)
Average: O(n^2)

### Difference to selection time compexity
Number of comparisons is equal, O(n^2) is all scenarios
Number of swaps is:
Worst-case: O(n)
Best-case: O(1)
